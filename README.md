# 🧪 EVALUATION ONLY - Deployment Pipeline Test

**⚠️ THIS IS NOT A PRODUCTION APPLICATION ⚠️**

## Purpose
Testing deployment pipeline and infrastructure capabilities:

- ✅ Vercel deployment functionality
- ✅ GitHub integration and CI/CD
- ✅ Custom domain setup (CNAME)
- ✅ URL parameter handling
- ✅ Static vs Dynamic content delivery
- ✅ Next.js hybrid architecture
- ✅ Integration readiness (GHL, Vapi, Supabase)

## What This Tests
1. **Deployment:** Can we deploy Next.js to Vercel successfully?
2. **URLs:** Do dynamic routes work with parameters?
3. **Templates:** Can we switch content based on URL params?
4. **Static Generation:** Can we create/serve static HTML files?
5. **Domain Setup:** Can we connect custom domains?

## What This Is NOT
- ❌ Final content or copy
- ❌ Production-ready features
- ❌ Accurate business logic
- ❌ Real user data or integrations
- ❌ Polished design or UX

## Next Steps
Once deployment pipeline is confirmed working:
1. Replace placeholder content with real specifications
2. Integrate with actual APIs (GHL, Supabase, Vapi)
3. Implement real authentication and data flows
4. Polish design and user experience
